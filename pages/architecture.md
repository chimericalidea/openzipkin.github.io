These are the components that make up a fully fledged tracing system. Spans must be transported from the services being traced to Zipkin collectors. There are two primary transports: Scribe and Kafka. Scribe is depicted.

Zipkin has four main components: collector, database, query service, and web UI.

Zipkin Collector
----------------

Once the trace data arrives at the Zipkin collector daemon we check that it's
valid, store it and the index it for lookups.

Storage
-------

We originally built Zipkin on Cassandra for storage. It's scalable, has a
flexible schema, and is heavily used within Twitter. However, we made this
component pluggable, and we now support Redis and MySQL.

Zipkin Query Service
--------------------

Once the data is stored and indexed we need a way to extract it. This is where
the query daemon comes in, providing a simple JSON api for finding and retrieving
traces. The primary consumer of this api is the Web UI.

Web UI
------
A GUI that presents a nice interface for viewing traces.
A GUI that presents a nice face for viewing traces. The web UI provides a
method for viewing traces based on service, time, and  annotations. Note that there is no built-in authentication in the UI.

Instrumented libraries
----------------------

Tracing information is collected on each host using the instrumented libraries
and sent to Zipkin. When the host makes a request to another service, it passes
a few tracing identifiers along with the request so we can later tie the data
together.
